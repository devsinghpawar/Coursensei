4.My requirement: This prompt is used to create a webpage, schedule event,etc. Make sense of the prompt and
replace the values from null to  givien input using prompt in the json given above, for values that haven't 
made sense of should stay null. Use value format to determine what vales to put.
After doing all of that give response of just the updated json and nothing else. Dont explain anything or greet
at the beginning response should start with '{' and end with '}'
