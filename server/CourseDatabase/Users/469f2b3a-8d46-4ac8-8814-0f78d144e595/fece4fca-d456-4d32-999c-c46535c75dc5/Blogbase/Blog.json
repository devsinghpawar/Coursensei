      "line": " The lion is a majestic and powerful animal, known for its regal appearance and fierce hunting abilities. Here are some interesting facts about lions:\n\n1. Lions are the only cats that live in groups, called prides. A pride can consist of up to 30 lions, including several females, their cubs, and one or more males.\n2. Lions are the largest of all the big cats, with males weighing up to 550 pounds (250 kg) and females weighing up to 350 pounds (160 kg).\n3. Lions are apex predators, which means they have no natural predators in the wild. They hunt a variety of prey, including zebras, wildebeests, and antelopes.\n4. Despite their size, lions are agile and can reach speeds of up to 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) when chasing prey.\n5. Lions are known for their distinctive manes, which are thick hairs around the head, neck, and shoulders of males. The mane serves as a sign of masculinity and helps to protect the lion's neck during fights.\n6. Lionesses do most of the hunting, using coordinated attacks and stealth to catch their prey. They also often work together to protect their territory from other predators.\n7. Lions are social animals and have a complex communication system that includes roars, growls, and body language. They use these signals to communicate with each other and maintain order within the pride.\n8. Lionesses often give birth to litters of two to six cubs, which are born after a gestation period of around 110 days. The cubs are born blind and weigh around 3 pounds (1.4 kg) at birth.\n9. Lions are found in grasslands and savannas in Africa and India, with the largest populations in Serengeti National Park in Tanzania and Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.\n10. Sadly, lions are vulnerable to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching. Their numbers have declined significantly over the past few decades, with only around 20,000 lions remaining in the wild today."
